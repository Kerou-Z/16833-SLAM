\section{Theory (40 points)}

In this part we are going to guide you through some steps of EKF-SLAM
in math. This will be helpful in your implementation in the next problem. 

A robot is moving on the 2D ground plane. In each time step $t$,
the robot is controlled to move forward (the $x$-direction of the
robot's coordinates) $d_{t}$ meters, and then rotate $\alpha_{t}$
radian. The pose of the robot in the global coordinates at time $t$
is written as a vector $\mathbf{p}_{t}=\left[\begin{array}{ccc}
x_{t} & y_{t} & \theta_{t}\end{array}\right]^{\top}$, where $x_{t}$ and $y_{t}$ are the 2D coordinates of the robot's
position, and $\theta_{t}$ is the robot's orientation.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Based on the assumption that there is no noise or error in the
control system, predict the next pose $\mathbf{p}_{t+1}$ as a nonlinear
function of the current pose $\mathbf{p}_{t}$ and the control inputs
$d_{t}$ and $\alpha_{t}$. (5 points) 

\item However, in reality there are some errors when the robot moves
due to the mechanism and the terrain. Assume the errors follow Gaussian
distributions: $e_{x}\sim\mathcal{N}\left(0,\sigma_{x}^{2}\right)$
in $x$-direction, $e_{y}\sim\mathcal{N}\left(0,\sigma_{y}^{2}\right)$
in $y$-direction, and $e_{\alpha}\sim\mathcal{N}\left(0,\sigma_{\alpha}^{2}\right)$
in rotation respectively (all in robot's coordinates). For details, please see Fig.~\ref{fig:1b}.
Now if the uncertainty of the robot's pose at time $t$ can be represented as
a 3-dimensional Gaussian distribution $\mathcal{N}\left(0,\Sigma_{t}\right)$,
what is the predicted uncertainty of the robot at time $t+1$? Please
express it as a Gaussian distribution with zero mean. (5 points)
\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.99\textwidth]{1b.png}
    \caption{0) Robot state; 1) robot moves $d_t$ along its x-axis;
    2) due to noise it shifted $e_x$ and $e_y$ along its x and y axises respectively;
    3) robot rotates $\alpha_t$ after shifting;    
    4) due to noise the rotation is disturbed by $e_\alpha$.}
    \label{fig:1b}
\end{figure}

\item Consider a landmark $l$ being observed by the robot at time $t$
with a laser sensor which gives a measurement of the bearing angle
$\beta$ (in the interval $(-\pi,\pi]$) and the range $r$, with
noise $n_{\beta}\sim\mathcal{N}\left(0,\sigma_{\beta}^{2}\right)$
and $n_{r}\sim\mathcal{N}\left(0,\sigma_{r}^{2}\right)$ respectively.
Write down the estimated position $\left(l_{x},l_{y}\right)$ of landmark
$l$ in global coordinates as a function of $\mathbf{p}_{t}$, $\beta$,
$r$, and the noise terms. (5 points)

\item According to 1.3, if we now know that $l$ is at $\left(l_{x},l_{y}\right)$
in the global coordinates, please predict the measurement of bearing
and range based on $l_{x}$, $l_{y}$, $\mathbf{p}_{t}$, and the
noise terms (use functions $\mathit{np.arctan2}(.)$ and $\mathit{warp2pi}(.)$
that warps an arbitrary angular value into the range $(-\pi,\pi]$
if needed). (5 points)

\item An important step in EKF-SLAM is to find the measurement Jacobian
$H_{p}$ with respect to the robot pose. Please apply the results
in (d) to derive the analytical form of $H_{p}$ (Note: $H_{p}$ should
be a $2\times3$ matrix represented by $\mathbf{p}_{t}$ and $l$).
(10 points)

\item For each measurement of bearing and range, we also need a measurement
Jacobian $H_{l}$ with respect to its corresponding landmark $l$.
Please again derive the analytical form of $H_{l}$ (Note: $H_{l}$
should be a $2\times2$ matrix represented by $\mathbf{p}_{t}$ and
$l$). Why do we not need to calculate the measurement Jacobian with
respect to other landmarks except for itself (Hint: based on what
assumption)? (10 points)
\end{enumerate}

Note in this section, in addition to conventional linearization with additive noise (in the form of $x_{t+1} = g(x_t, u_t) + \epsilon_t$), you may encounter non-additive noise (in the form of $x_{t+1} = g(x_t, u_t, \epsilon_t))$. \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Kalman_filter#Non-additive_noise_formulation_and_equations}{Derivation of the linearization} for this formulation can be helpful.
Also, all the noise reading ($\epsilon, n$) can be regarded as infinitismal. Second and higher order terms comprised by their products can be ignored.

\section{Implementation and Evaluation (45 points)}

In this part you will implement your own 2D EKF-SLAM solver in Python.
The robot in problem 1 starts with observing the surrounding environment
and measuring some landmarks, then executes a control input to move.
The measurement and control steps are repeated several times. For
simplicity, we assume the robot observes the same set of landmarks
in the same order at each pose. We want to use EKF-SLAM to recover
the trajectory of the robot and the positions of the landmarks from
the control input and measurements. 

\begin{enumerate}
\item Find the data file $\mathtt{data/data.txt}$ that contains the
control inputs and measurements. Open the file to take a look. The
data is in the format of measurements$=\left[\begin{array}{ccccc}
\beta_{1} & r_{1} & \beta_{2} & r_{2} & \cdots\end{array}\right]$, where $\beta_{i}$, $r_{i}$ correspond to landmark $l_{i}$, and control$=\left[\begin{array}{cc}
    d & \alpha\end{array}\right]$ (refer to problem 1 for the notations). The
lines are in sequential time order. 

What is the fixed number
of landmarks being observed over the entire sequence? (5 points)

\item The $\mathtt{code/}$ folder contains the Python code file
$\mathtt{ekf\_slam.py}$. Follow the comments and fill in the functions $\mathtt{warp2pi},~\mathtt{init\_landmarks}, ~\mathtt{predict}, ~\mathtt{update}$ to enable the system. The visualization will show the trajectory and the landmarks with their covariances in the shape of 3-$\sigma$ ellises. It will be updated sequentially, and you may process the next step by clicking your mouse or hitting any key.

Attach a clear figure of your
visualization in the write up once all the steps are finished. (25 points)

\item In the output figure, the magenta and blue ellipses represent
the predicted and updated uncertainties of the robot's position (orientation
not shown here) at each time respectively. Also, the red and green
ellipses represent the initial and all the updated uncertainties of
the landmarks, respectively. 

Describe how EKF-SLAM improves the estimation
of both the trajectory and the map by comparing the uncertainty ellipses.
(5 points)

\item Now let's evaluate our output map. Suppose we have the ground
truth positions of all the landmarks: 

$\left[\begin{array}{cccc}
l_{1}^{\top} & l_{2}^{\top} & \cdots & l_{k}^{\top}\end{array}\right]=\left[\begin{array}{cccccccccccc}
3 & 6 & 3 & 12 & 7 & 8 & 7 & 14 & 11 & 6 & 11 & 12\end{array}\right]$.

Plot the ground truth positions of the landmarks in the output figure
(code already provided in function $\mathtt{evaluate}$)
and attach it below. Is each of them inside the smallest corresponding
ellipse? What does that mean? 

Compute and report the \emph{Euclidean} and
\emph{Mahalanobis} distances of each landmark estimation with respect
to the ground truth. What do the numbers tell you? (10 points)
\end{enumerate}

\section{Discussion (15 points)}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Explain why the zero terms in the initial landmark covariance
matrix become non-zero in the final state covariance matrix (print
out the final $P$ matrix to check it). Additionally, when setting
the initial value for the full covariance matrix $P$ (line 201 in
$\mathtt{ekf\_slam.py}$) an assumption is made regarding certain cross-covariances
that is not necessarily correct. Can you point out what that is? (5
points)

\item Play with the parameters (line 163-167). Modify each parameter~$\sigma_{x}$,
$\sigma_{y}$, $\sigma_{\alpha}$$\sigma_{b}$, $\sigma_{r}$ at a
time and fix the others. In particular, you should set each parameter
to be 10 times larger/smaller to the original parameters to discuss
how each parameters influence the results. Attach figures for
better explanation. (10 points)


\item With the same set of landmarks being observed all the time, the
EKF-SLAM system runs in constant time in each iteration. However,
for real-world problems, the total number of landmarks can grow unbounded
if the robot keeps exploring new environments. This will slow down
the EKF-SLAM system a lot and become a crucial problem for real-time
applications. What changes can we make to the EKF-SLAM framework to
achieve constant computation time in each cycle or at least speed
up the process (list as many possible solutions as you can think of)?
(Bonus 5 points)
